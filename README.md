# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to use unsupervised machine learning models to determine what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can best be grouped together.

The data available is not ideal, so first we will cleanse the data, reduce the number of dimensions using PCA, cluster it using K-means, and finally create visualizations (both 2D and 3D) to share with the board of Accountability Accounting.
